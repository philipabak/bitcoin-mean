    <p>The 1990’s were a fascinating time for the technology industry. A revolutionary resource became commercially popularized: the World Wide Web. After CERN donated the World Wide Web technology to the world in 1993, the world’s ability to relay information and conduct commerce has flourished. Within the first year of the World Wide Web over two million computers were connected to the Internet, though mostly used in the academic community, scientists, and corporate researchers.</p>
    <p>However, the information industry was far from the only one to see the power that this new technology possessed. That same year, the retail industry took advantage of the simplicity of exchanging resources with the launch of the now retail giant, Amazon.com. [1] The World Wide Web helped the commerce industry reach new demographics of people, such as the homebound, and connect merchants and consumers over larger distances.</p>
    <p>Along with the retail industry, the gambling industry did its part to spearhead the Internet boom. 1994 saw the introduction of what is now referred to as online gambling. Microgaming, a software business, reached out to an ally in the monetary encryption field called Cryptologic to develop the first cyber gambling venture. [2] Many small countries also recognized the financial gain potential of connecting the World Wide Web and the sport of gambling. A sixty one square mile country sandwiched by Austria and Switzerland called Liechtenstein has invested capital into driving the growth of cyber gambling. The investment propelled the micro country to having the second highest gross domestic product per capita in the world. [3]</p>
    <p>Three years after the introduction of online gambling, the industry began bringing in revenue exceeding one billion dollars per year. By 2001, revenues grew well over seven hundred percent. [4] Yet, many major nations fail to benefit from the massive success of cyber gambling. Business that provide Internet gambling avenues for betting enthusiasts tend to be based out of small island countries including New Zealand, Costa Rica, and Antigua. This is primarily caused by very restrictive laws set in place by legislators in commercialized nations with large populations. Since Egyptian, Roman, Chinese, and many modern day countries have historically kept a watchful eye on the idea of gambling, it was only natural for its Internet popularity to catch the eye of governmental bodies and regulation to begin. [5]</p>
    <p>The United States is host to the world headquarters of gambling in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, the country has not been a friend of many means of gambling remotely. Two United States governmental agencies, the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve Board, conduced a teamed declaration of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. [6] This law drastically limited the ways that gambling companies are lawfully able to receive payment. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 put a damper on much of the growing popularity of gambling sites and blocked the supply for tax paying businesses that are
    participants in providing a means for consumers to bet on outcomes and events, which has caused a black market to populate within the industry.</p>
    <p>While sports betting and casino style gambling have been made illegal in one way or another in much of the industrialized world, one type of betting has seemed to slip through the cracks and give gambling aficionados a means of participating: games of chance. Remotely betting on games of chance such as a lottery has been deemed acceptable in some countries, such as the United Kingdom. The legality of games of chance was differentiated prior to the dawn of the World Wide Web. The United Kingdom’s Royal Commission Report on Gambling of 1978 defines requirements for different licensing for a casino operating license than that of a license for games of chance in section 65 of the 1978 Royal Commission Report on Gambling. As the legislation states: “Bingo is a lottery played as a game.” [7] Being that every participant is the recipient of randomized chart of numbers, the chances of winning are fair and equal for all players. Thus began the fortification of online gambling once again. Lotteries and bingo have been provided a stronghold against the growing amount of legislation restricting the means for which cyber gambling is lawful. The United Kingdom Gambling commission defines bingo with a fairly open interpretation. The rule simply requires the game to be played with a set and definitive end point, involving a level of participation from a group of individuals, and having the same amount of chance for each participant. There is no limit on the value of awarded prizes or jackpot size. [8] Because of the lenient legislation in the United Kingdom on games of chance, games of chance have received the nutrients necessary to flourish in an industry that is otherwise struggling to gain legal foothold.</p>
    <p>Around the year 2010, the United Kingdom National Lottery launched a website which participants are able go to for placing bets. This lead to a full one percent increase nation wide in betting, as stated by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission’s statistics from April 2008 to September 2011. [9] While one percent seems like a small increase, that number equates to well over one half of a million new people participating in betting in the nation. Big Fish Games Incorporated, headquartered in the United States, saw the untapped niche of the increasingly popular mobile device application market and drew a connection between that market and remote gambling. In 2012, Big Fish Games Inc. launched the first real world money betting application to be available on the Apple App Store. Big Fish Games estimates that mobile device betting will rapidly see revenue in excess of one hundred billion dollars each year. [10] The extremely high figure most certainly caught the attention of the United Kingdom national government, who intends on also capitalizing on the increasing popularity of online gambling. Per the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act of 2014, a fifteen percent point of consumption tax has been imposed within the nation and extends the reach of the United Kingdom government ability to require territories and regions under British control to also be licensed through the United Kingdom Gambling Commission. [11]</p>
    <p>Games of chance are no longer the solo avenue for gambling enthusiasts to venture down legally. Many major countries that have legislation restricting online gambling do not allow the transaction of national currencies to organizations which host cyber betting operations. That leaves digital currencies in a peculiar position. Digital currency can be used to make purchases electronically, much like its conventional counterparts such as the euro, yen, or dollar, which are now traded digitally as well. The differing characteristic between conventional currency and digital currency is that digital currency is decentralized, meaning there is not a sole body controlling a cyber currency network. [12]</p>
    <p>The digital currency that has been leading the industry’s frontier is called Bitcoin. The idea behind Bitcoin was proposed in a thesis titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to- Peer Electronic Cash System” written by a person (or collective of people) going by the pseudonym of “Satoshi Nakamoto”. [13] While much speculation is tossed around as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is, the true identity of the person or group remains a mystery. [14] “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” defines the purpose of the digital currency as being a peer-to-peer electronic cash that can be used to send payments between parties without using a financial institution which often take a cut of the money. [13]
    <p>Being that Bitcoin was designed with the idea that there will be no central body to oversee the currency, many governments have struggled with how to view Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies and how “cryptocurrency” might fit in with the existing framework. In April 2012, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation expressed fears that encompass Bitcoin specifically. The main concern was the potential for it to harbor the transaction for criminals to use without being tracked. That is precisely what was happening. Silk Road was an online marketplace based on complete anonymity of consumers and merchants, which embraced the anonymous nature of Bitcoin use. The site was mostly used for the sale of illegal goods and services. In October of 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down Silk Road and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration seized Bitcoin for the first time in digital currency history. [15]</p>
    <p>In addition to the trade of illicit products and services, digital currency has become increasingly popular in attempt to side step the online gambling laws in many countries. Bitcoin transactions are conducted with very limited or no cost to either party. Furthermore, the transactions are irreversible, which does away with the risk of chargeback fraud. This means when a bettor wins he or she receives the payout instantly and does not need to worry if the payment will be processed. The direct payment cuts out the bureaucracy of exchanging payouts to cash, which is standard in brick and mortar casinos. Without the overhead of maintaining physical tokens, hiring staff to protect the physical currency, or staff to change out tokens for national currencies, an Internet casino are financially able to reduce the house edge tenfold and pass the winning potential on to the consumer. [16]</p>
    <p>The process is anonymous and transparent, but is it legal? That remains to be seen. Some Bitcoin gambling sites have taken to blocking IP addresses from the United States. While it is not inherently illegal to gamble with a digital currency in the United States at this time, digital currency is in currently floating in legal grey water that some online gambling companies would rather not wade in. The United States leaves the legality of gambling to the individual states and unless violating a state law, feds will not take action against gambling violations. Roughly half of the states do not have laws specifically prohibiting cyber gambling. The other half of the states have laws that have yet to be updated since the dawn of online gambling let alone Bitcoin betting. [16]
    <p>Virtual currency and cyber gambling are still in their infancy. The legislation has struggled to keep up with both technology and gambling. The demand for remote gambling is clear. Consumers are craving a currency with a higher level of anonymity and transparency. Governmental powers see the financial gains being made on the new technology of digital currencies and appear fully set on eating their slice of the pie. The future of Bitcoin use for cyber gambling remains as puzzling as the digital currency’s creator itself.</p>
