MoneyPot (formerly a gambling game that was moved to bustabit.com) needs beta-testers for our new service.


## MoneyPot Apps

### For Developers

The MoneyPot API allows developers to create Bitcoin apps without having to reimplement user registration, the Bitcoin interaction, and the entire gambling mechanism. 

Instead, developers can implement a "Login with MoneyPot" button and let MoneyPot handle the user authentication, bitcoin deposits/withdrawals, bets, and more.

Developers get to focus on building good apps. (Note: API docs still under construction)

### For Users

Users get to authorize apps and then move money from their MoneyPot wallet into the app so they can spend it there.

For example: If you have 1 bitcoin (1,000,000 bits) in your MoneyPot account, you can deposit half of it into the DustDice app. Now, when you go to DustDice, DustDice only has access to half a bitcoin.

You can transfer bits between your MoneyPot wallet and individual apps at any time. When you're done with an app? Simply disable it.

## Manage your money in one place

You can transfer your bitcoin between your MoneyPot wallet, apps, and your investment in the global bankroll. Our goal is to make this as simple as possible.

When you want your money out of the pot, just send it to any bitcoin address so it's back in your pocket.

## Comprehensive balance history

Every time your balance changes for any reason, we create a history item so that you can audit exactly what happens to your money while it's under our control.

## Send money

Your money is yours. As you'd expect, you can send from MoneyPot to any bitcoin address. But you can also send directly to other MoneyPot users without any fees.

## Generate addresses

You can use MoneyPot as a general-purpose wallet without even using any apps.

For every address you generate, you can attach a private note to yourself for what it was for. You can also create "Cold" addresses which will be kept out of our hot wallet for your privacy.

## Secure your account

You can enable and disable two-factor authentication as your please.

But we also keep track of every login attempt on your account, every active session, and the IP address of each session for your inspection.
